The Pybytes Open APIs help you to get access to the devices, the projects, and their releases outside the Pybytes.

With Open APIs you can access and transfer data related to your **Devices**, **Network Settings**, **Projects** and **Releases**.

Open APIs use Tokens [as described below](https://docs.pycom.io/pybytes/open-api/gettingstartedopenapi/).

Your Tokenâ€™s Scope level may enable you to modify the data itself.
