The Pybytes Open APIs help you to get access to the devices, to the projects, and their releases outside the Pybytes.

With Open APIs you can access and transfer data related to your **User**, **Devices**, **Network Settings**, **Projects** and **Releases**.

Open APIs use Tokens [as described below](https://docs.pycom.io/pybytes/open-api/gettingstartedopenapi/).

Depends on the Access Token scopes, you will be able also to modify the data as well.
