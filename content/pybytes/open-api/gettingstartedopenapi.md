3. During the creation of the Token, choose the **Scopes** that you want to give to this token and generate it.

    ### Capabilities
    You will have the choice between different accessibility level.
    You have the **Read** and **Write** Scope that you can give for the **User**, **Devices**, **Network Settings**, **Projects** and 
    **Releases**.
    This will determine what you can and can't do when you are logged in with this token.

### Security
Each **Token** is unique and can never be asked for again. So be sure to copy and save it.
