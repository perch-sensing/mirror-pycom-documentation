After installing the Mobile App, you will be asked to connect your device.  

Make sure:

1. Your PyGo is charged and switched on.
2. You turn on the BBluetooth on your Mobile Phone.
3. Your PyGo is within a few meters from your phone.

This can also be done anytime in the Devices menu section.

From the Mobile App, go to Add a PyGo and tap `Start Scanning`

The Pylife Mobile App will use your mobile phoneâ€™s Bluetooth signal to look for PyGos.

After the PyGo device is found, you will be asked to give it the name.

Enter the name you would like to give your PyGo.

Your added devices are displayed under the Devices menu section.

You can add more than one PyGo to your App. If you add more than one PyGo, make sure to give each PyGo an obvious name.
