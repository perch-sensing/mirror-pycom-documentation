## What is Pylife?

The Pylife App is our digital dashboard, where you will find all of your PyGo devices and their owners. It has messaging, mapping and visualisation features, all in a bid to connect a community of people.

We have spent years in the technology field developing multi-network solutions. This means that the Pylife app will work with five different types of network. That means that youâ€™re not paying for a device that only works in certain cases.

* Create groups, invite your people add devices;
* Create alerts from templates for your devices, configure them;
* Monitor activity of your devices, receive real-time updates;
* Share your activity with your people through groups;

## WARNING 
The PyGo is not a toy!  
To avoid danger of suffocation, please keep out of reach of babies, children, and pets. These must be supervised when a PyGo is attached to them. 


**IMPORTANT:** Please make sure you first open the PyGo case inside a building (out of sight of Satellites) and proceed to updating the firmware via the Pylife App as described below.
