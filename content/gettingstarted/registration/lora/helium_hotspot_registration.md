Helium’s network is referred to as The People's Network. It is powered by an entirely new incentive model - made possible by their Helium Blockchain.
Installing a LoRa Hotspot means you are rewarded in HNT crypto coins as soon as you have [“Proof-of-Coverage”](https://docs.helium.com/blockchain/proof-of-coverage/).
