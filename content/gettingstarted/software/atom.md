## Connecting via Serial USB

After installing the Pymakr Plugin, you need to take a few seconds to configure it for first time use. Please follow these steps:

1. Connect your Pycom device to your computer via USB. If you are using an Expansion Board 2.0, and have just finished a firmware upgrade, be sure to **remove the wire between GND and G23** and reset your device by pressing the button.
   Note: you don't need the wire for Expansion Board 3.0

1. Open Atom and ensure that the Pymakr Plugin has correctly installed.

2. Pymakr has auto-connection enabled by default. In case your device hasn't connected right away, click on `Connect device` and then on your device.

3. Now it should show three arrows `>>>`, indicating that you are connected!

These settings can also be applied on a per project basis by clicking `Settings` then `Project Settings`. This will open a JSON file which you can edit to enter your desired settings.

>This process is easiest with either a Pycom Expansion Board or a Pytrack/Pysense as the addresses are automatically selected. For external products such as FTDI USB Serial Cables, the serial address may need to be copied manually. Additionally, the reset button on the device may also need to be pressed before a connection message appears.
