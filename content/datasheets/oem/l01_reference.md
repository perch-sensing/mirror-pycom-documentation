The L01 OEM reference board is a reference design suitable for the L01 as well as the W01. It makes it possible to have a single PCB design that can accommodate both of the  OEM modules.

> If you require a reference board for the L04 or G01, this design is **not** suitable as it does not feature a SIM slot or the double antenna connection. For the L04 or G01 please use the [Universal OEM Baseboard Reference](../universal_reference)

## Features

* Suits both L01 or W01 OEM Modules
* U.FL connector for the L01's LoRa output
* On-board 2.4GHz antenna for WiFi and Bluetooth, with the ability to switch to an external antenna via a U.FL connector
* WS2812B RGB LED
* DC-DC regulator (3.5 - 5.5V) input with low current draw during Deep Sleep
* Reset button

> The reference board has exactly the same pinout as a developmnent module and can be used in its place!
