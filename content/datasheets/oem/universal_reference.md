The universal OEM reference board is a reference design suitable for the W01, L01, L04 and G01 OEM modules, making it possible to have a single PCB design that can accommodate all of our OEM modules.

>If you require a reference board for the G01, this design is the only one that is suitable. The L01 reference board does not contain the necessary SIM slot.


## Features

* Suits all of the OEM modules \(L01, L04, W01, G01\)
* On-board 2.4GHz antenna for WiFi and Bluetooth, with the ability to switch to an external antenna via a U.FL connector.
* 3 U.FL connectors for all the outputs available on the OEM modules
* SIM card holder
* WS2812B RGB LED
* DC-DC regulator (3.5 - 5.5V) input with low current draw during Deep Sleep
* Reset button

> The reference board has exactly the same pinout as a developmnent module and can be used in its place!
